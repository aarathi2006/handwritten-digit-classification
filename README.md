# handwritten-digit-classification
# 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning and deep learning-based system to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from image data. The model learns visual patterns from pixel-level data and predicts the correct digit using image processing and classification techniques.
The project uses the popular MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of labeled grayscale images of handwritten digits. The system is designed to demonstrate practical applications of computer vision and image classification.
